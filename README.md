# OSU CS340 Project

This project provided hands-on experience in designing a robust relational database using open-source MySQL. ER diagrams were crafted and normalization principles were applied to develop an optimized database schema that ensures data integrity and efficiency. Building on this foundation, the robust backend was integrated with a responsive frontend built using Flask.
